i ported my game framework to java using slick 2d game engine.
when i have more time i will write tutorials on how to use it.
it works almost the same as my js engine. you can take a look at it:

the raw code is inside "raw code" folder.
the eclipse project is in "eclipse exports", to see the tuts in action use export all.
to create your own peoject export blank_project.
